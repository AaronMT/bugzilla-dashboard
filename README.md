## Bugzilla Dashboard ##

This is a simple dashboard to help users of Mozilla's Bugzilla
instance keep track of their bugs. It can also be used to get a quick
idea of what a community member is currently working on.

The dashboard uses the [Bugzilla REST API][] for all communication
with the Bugzilla instance. Since the API supports cross-origin
XMLHttpRequest, no other server-side component is needed for the
dashboard; as such, feel free to run the dashboard directly from your
computer and modify its user interface as you see fit.

Please report any bugs or feature requests at the project's [Github Issue Tracker][].
